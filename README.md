# Embedded-Project-
This project integrates the Arduino Multi-Function Shield with the NUCLEO-F401RE board to implement a real-time clock (RTC). The shield features a 4-digit 7-segment display, buttons, and a potentiometer. The RTC displays elapsed time and allows the user to view an analog voltage reading when a button is pressed.
